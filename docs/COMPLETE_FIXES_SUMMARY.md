# Complete Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Order Placement Error (Internal Server Error)

**Problem**: Users were experiencing "Internal server error" when trying to place orders through the checkout system.

**Root Cause**: Database constraint violation in the `orders` table. The `customer_info` and `cart` columns had NOT NULL constraints but were not being included in the INSERT query.

**Solution**: Modified `API/place_order.php` to include the required `customer_info` and `cart` fields in the INSERT query.

**Files Modified**:
- `API/place_order.php` - Fixed the INSERT query to include required fields

**Result**: ✅ Order placement now works correctly without internal server errors.

### 2. JavaScript Error in Checkout

**Problem**: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'add')` in `checkout.js` at line 13.

**Root Cause**: The `selectDelivery` and `selectPayment` functions were trying to use `event.currentTarget` but `event` was not defined as a parameter.

**Solution**: Modified the functions to find the correct DOM elements using `querySelector` and `closest()` methods.

**Files Modified**:
- `js/checkout.js` - Fixed the `selectDelivery` and `selectPayment` functions

**Result**: ✅ JavaScript errors resolved, checkout interface works smoothly.

### 3. Profile Not Fetching Postal Code

**Problem**: The profile page was not displaying postal code and other address information from the checkout data.

**Root Cause**: The Profile.php was only fetching basic user information (first_name, last_name, email, phone, created_at) but not the address-related fields.

**Solution**: Updated the Profile.php to fetch and display address, city, and postal_code fields.

**Files Modified**:
- `API/Profile.php` - Updated SQL query and data processing to include address fields

**Result**: ✅ Profile now correctly displays postal code and address information from checkout data.

## Technical Details

### Database Structure
The system uses these key tables:
- **users**: Contains user information including address fields (address, city, postal_code)
- **orders**: Contains order information with JSON fields for customer_info and cart
- **order_items**: Contains individual order items

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Order Placement Fix
```php
// Before: Missing required fields
$insert_fields = ['user_id', 'subtotal', 'tax', 'delivery_fee', 'total'];

// After: Including required fields
$insert_fields = ['user_id', 'subtotal', 'tax', 'delivery_fee', 'total'];
if (in_array('customer_info', $existing_columns)) {
    $insert_fields[] = 'customer_info';
    $insert_values[] = json_encode($customer_info);
    $bind_types .= 's';
}
if (in_array('cart', $existing_columns)) {
    $insert_fields[] = 'cart';
    $insert_values[] = json_encode($cart);
    $bind_types .= 's';
}
```

#### 2. JavaScript Fix
```javascript
// Before: Using undefined event object
event.currentTarget.classList.add('selected');

// After: Finding element correctly
const deliveryOption = document.querySelector(`input[value="${method}"]`).closest('.delivery-option');
if (deliveryOption) {
    deliveryOption.classList.add('selected');
}
```

#### 3. Profile Data Fetching Fix
```php
// Before: Limited user data
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT first_name, last_name, email, phone, created_at FROM users WHERE id = ?");

// After: Including address fields
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT first_name, last_name, email, phone, address, city, postal_code, created_at FROM users WHERE id = ?");
```

## Testing Results

### Order Placement Testing
- ✅ Database connection works
- ✅ All required tables exist
- ✅ User creation/retrieval works
- ✅ Order insertion with required fields works
- ✅ Order items insertion works
- ✅ Email service loads correctly

### Profile Testing
- ✅ Address data is being fetched correctly
- ✅ City data is being fetched correctly
- ✅ Postal code field is available (shows "Not provided" for users without postal code data)
- ✅ Profile displays all address information when available

### JavaScript Testing
- ✅ Delivery method selection works without errors
- ✅ Payment method selection works without errors
- ✅ Checkout interface functions properly

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Smooth Checkout Process**: Users can now complete orders without encountering internal server errors
2. **Better Profile Information**: Users can see their complete address information including postal code
3. **Responsive Interface**: Checkout form interactions work smoothly without JavaScript errors
4. **Data Consistency**: Address information entered during checkout is properly stored and displayed in the profile

## Prevention Measures

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always check database constraints when modifying table structures
2. Ensure all required fields are included in INSERT queries
3. Use comprehensive testing to verify database operations
4. Monitor error logs for constraint violations
5. Test JavaScript functions thoroughly, especially those that handle DOM events
6. Validate that all form data is properly fetched and displayed in user profiles

## Files Modified Summary

1. `API/place_order.php` - Fixed order placement database constraints
2. `js/checkout.js` - Fixed JavaScript event handling errors
3. `API/Profile.php` - Enhanced profile data fetching to include address information

All systems are now working correctly and users can successfully place orders and view their complete profile information.
